## 📍 Citizen Reporting Module

Citizens often face challenges when reporting local issues (potholes, damaged infrastructure, violations).  
This module of Daleel provides:
- A mobile & web interface for citizens to submit issue reports with **photos, GPS, and category**.
- A dashboard for **officials** to track, assign, and resolve issues.
- Status updates so citizens can follow the resolution process.
- AI-powered clustering to detect **hotspot areas** with frequent issues.

### Entities
- **Report**: description, photo(s), location, category, urgency, citizen ID.
- **Official Response**: status updates (pending, in-progress, resolved), assigned official.
- **Analytics**: frequent issue categories, map-based visualization.

### Example Citizen Workflow
1. Open Daleel mobile/web.
2. Go to "Report Local Issue".
3. Fill details (location auto-detect, photo upload, description).
4. Submit → backend saves → official dashboard updated.
5. Citizen gets status updates (e.g., “assigned”, “resolved”).
